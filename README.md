## Widget definition

The first step is to fill the menu table with a menu structure. This can be achieved with the built-in methods of the MenuItems ActiveRecord:

### add_menu_item

> Defines the text that will be shown for this menu item in the SideNav Widget.

* url (String) (optional)
> The url where the menu item will link in the sidenav.

* parent (String) (optional)
> Name of the parent menu item. This will create a hierarchical menu.

* name (String) (optional)
> Name of the menu item, if not defined, will use the label text.

* icon (String) (optional)
> CSS Bootstrap icon name that will be shown next to the menu item text.

* options (String) (optional)
> HTML Options that will be added into the menu item.

* visible (String) (optional)
> If 0, the menu item and all its children won't be shown at the sidenav.


### delete_menu_item

Warning: It deletes the menu item and all its children.

* name (String) (obligatory)
> Name of the menu item, that will be deleted.

### hide_menu_item

Warning: This will hide the menu item and all its children.

* name (String) (obligatory)
